Motivations for linear algebra

The first problem I might think of is one of price discovery. Say I go shopping on two occasions, and I buy apples and bananas, and the first time I buy two apples and three bananas and they cost eight Euros. And the second time I buy say, ten apples and one banana, and the cost is 13 Euros. And the As and the Bs here, are the price of a single apple and a single banana. And what I'm going to have to do is solve these what we call simultaneous equations in order to discover the price of individual apples and bananas. Now in the general case of lots of different types of items and lots of shopping trips, then finding out the prices might be quite hard.

2a + 3b = 8
10a + 1b = 13

 |2  3| |a| = | 8|
 |10 1| |b|   |13|

 It might be quite difficult to solve all these equations by hand. So, we might want a computer algorithm to do it for us, in the general case. Now, this is an example of a Linear Algebra problem. I have some constant linear coefficients here, these numbers 2, 10, 3, 1, that relate the input variables A and B, to the output 8 and 13, that is if I think about a vector [a,b], that describes the prices of apples and bananas. Then this gets translated into a cost, to find out how many I might want to buy, and the cost happens to be 8 on the first trip, and 13 Euros on the second trip. And I can write this down as a matrix problem where the 2, 3 is my first trip, and the 10, 1 is my second trip, and then these are then matrices, that's a matrix then, and these are vectors, and what we're going to do over the course of modules one to three, is build up, Looking at these different types of mathematical objects, and understanding what they are and how to work with them, these vectors and these matrices. And then, we'll come back and figure out how to solve this problem in the general case.
