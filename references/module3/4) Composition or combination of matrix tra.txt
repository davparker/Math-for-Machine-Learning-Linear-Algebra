Composition or combination of matrix transformations - module 3

Well, if you want to do any shape alteration, save all the pixels in an image of a face or something like that, then you can always make that shape change out of some combination of rotations, shear structures and inverses. That is if I first apply one translation A1 to a vector r, then that makes some first change. Then if I apply another translation A2 to the results of that, then I can perform a composition of the two translations. What I've done is I've performed first A1 and then A2 to r. 

Understanding Geometric Transformations and Matrix Multiplication

In the video, we learned about geometric transformations, which are ways to change the position or shape of objects in space. Imagine you have a piece of paper with a drawing on it. You can rotate it, flip it, or slide it around. Each of these actions is a transformation. When we apply these transformations to vectors (which are like arrows pointing in a direction), we can combine them to create new shapes or positions. For example, if you first rotate your drawing and then flip it, the final result will be different than if you flipped it first and then rotated it.

To make sense of these transformations mathematically, we use matrices. Think of a matrix as a set of instructions for how to change the vectors. When we multiply matrices, we are essentially applying one transformation after another. However, it's important to note that the order in which we apply these transformations matters! Just like how flipping a pancake and then adding syrup is different from adding syrup and then flipping it, the sequence of matrix multiplication can lead to different results. This is why we say that matrix multiplication is not commutative, meaning A2 followed by A1 is not the same as A1 followed by A2.

A geometric transformation is a way to change the position, size, or shape of a geometric figure in space. Here are the main types of geometric transformations:

    Translation: Moving a shape from one place to another without changing its size or orientation. For example, sliding a triangle to the right.

    Rotation: Turning a shape around a fixed point (called the center of rotation) by a certain angle. For instance, rotating a square 90 degrees clockwise around its center.

    Reflection: Flipping a shape over a line (called the line of reflection) to create a mirror image. For example, reflecting a triangle over a vertical line.

    Scaling: Changing the size of a shape while keeping its proportions the same. For example, doubling the size of a rectangle.

These transformations can be combined to create more complex changes to shapes.


You can combine different geometric transformations by applying them one after the other to a shape or object. This process is often done using matrices in mathematics. Hereâ€™s how it works:

    Sequential Application: You perform one transformation and then apply the next transformation to the result of the first. For example:

        First, you might rotate a shape.
        Then, you can translate (slide) the rotated shape to a new position.

    Matrix Representation: Each transformation can be represented by a matrix. When you combine transformations, you multiply their corresponding matrices. The order of multiplication matters:

        If you apply transformation A first and then transformation B, you multiply the matrix for B by the matrix for A (B * A).
        If you switch the order, the result will be different (A * B).

    Example:
        Rotation: A matrix that rotates a shape by 90 degrees.
        Reflection: A matrix that reflects a shape over a vertical line.
        If you first rotate and then reflect, you multiply the reflection matrix by the rotation matrix.

This combination allows you to create complex transformations that can change the shape's position, orientation, and size in a systematic way. 


The process of combining geometric transformations involves the following steps:

    1. Identify Transformations: Determine which transformations you want to apply (e.g., rotation, translation, reflection, scaling).

    2. Represent Transformations with Matrices: Each transformation can be represented by a matrix. For example:

        Rotation: A matrix that rotates points by a certain angle.
        Translation: A matrix that shifts points by a certain distance.
        Reflection: A matrix that flips points over a line.

    3. Order of Transformations: Decide the order in which you want to apply the transformations. Remember, the order matters because transformations are not commutative.

    4. Matrix Multiplication: Multiply the matrices of the transformations in the order you want to apply them. For example, if you want to apply transformation A first and then transformation B, you would compute B * A.

    5. Apply the Combined Transformation: Once you have the resulting matrix from the multiplication, you can apply this combined transformation matrix to the original points or shape. This will give you the final transformed shape.

Visualize the Result: It can be helpful to visualize the transformations step by step to understand how the shape changes with each transformation.
This systematic approach allows you to combine multiple transformations into a single operation.


Matrices play a crucial role in geometric transformations by providing a systematic way to represent and perform these transformations mathematically. Here are the key roles of matrices in transformations:

    1. Representation of Transformations: Each geometric transformation (such as rotation, translation, reflection, and scaling) can be represented by a specific matrix. This allows us to use matrix operations to apply transformations.

    2. Combining Transformations: When multiple transformations are needed, matrices can be multiplied together to create a single transformation matrix. This combined matrix can then be applied to points or shapes, simplifying the process of applying multiple transformations.

    3. Efficient Computation: Using matrices allows for efficient calculations, especially when dealing with multiple points or complex shapes. Instead of applying transformations one by one, you can apply a single matrix to all points at once.

    4. Linear Transformations: Matrices are particularly useful for linear transformations, which include operations that preserve straight lines and the origin. This means that the output of a linear transformation will still be a linear combination of the input.

    5. Coordinate Changes: Matrices can also be used to change the coordinate system of a shape, allowing for easier manipulation and analysis in different contexts.

In summary, matrices provide a powerful and efficient way to represent, combine, and compute geometric transformations.


Matrix multiplication has several real-world applications across various fields. Here are two notable examples:

    1. Computer Graphics:
        In computer graphics, matrix multiplication is used to perform transformations on images and 3D models. For instance, when rendering a scene, transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling of objects are represented as matrices. By multiplying these transformation matrices, you can efficiently compute the final position and orientation of objects in a scene.

    2. Data Science and Machine Learning:
        In machine learning, matrix multiplication is fundamental for operations involving datasets. For example, when training a model, input data (features) is often represented as a matrix. The model parameters (weights) are also represented as matrices. By multiplying the input matrix with the weight matrix, you can compute predictions or outputs, which is essential for tasks like classification and regression.

These applications highlight the importance of matrix multiplication in processing and transforming data in practical scenarios.


Matrix multiplication can be applied in various ways in data science projects. Here are two key applications:

    1. Linear Regression:
        - In linear regression, the relationship between input features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable) can be expressed using matrices.
        - The equation can be represented as: [ Y = X \cdot W ] where:
            (Y) is the output vector (predicted values),
            (X) is the input feature matrix,
            (W) is the weight vector (coefficients).
        - By multiplying the feature matrix (X) with the weight vector (W), you can predict the target variable (Y).

    2. Neural Networks:
        - In neural networks, matrix multiplication is used to compute the outputs of each layer.
        - Each layer's output is calculated by multiplying the input matrix by the weight matrix of that layer, followed by applying an activation function.
        - For example, if you have an input matrix (X) and a weight matrix (W) for a layer, the output (O) can be computed as: [ O = f(X \cdot W) ] where (f) is the activation function.
        - This process is repeated across multiple layers to make predictions.

These applications demonstrate how matrix multiplication is essential for modeling and making predictions in data science projects.


Matrix multiplication in data science refers to the mathematical operation of multiplying two matrices to produce a third matrix. This operation is fundamental in various data science tasks, particularly in machine learning and statistical modeling. Here are some key points:

    Definition: Given two matrices (A) (of size (m \times n)) and (B) (of size (n \times p)), their product (C) (of size (m \times p)) is calculated by taking the dot product of the rows of (A) with the columns of (B).

    Applications:

        Data Representation: Data is often represented in matrix form, where rows correspond to observations (samples) and columns correspond to features (variables).
        
        Model Training: In machine learning, matrix multiplication is used to compute predictions, update weights during training, and perform transformations on data.
        
        Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) use matrix multiplication to transform data into a lower-dimensional space.
    
    Efficiency: Matrix multiplication allows for efficient computation of linear transformations, making it essential for handling large datasets and complex models.

Overall, matrix multiplication is a core operation that enables various algorithms and techniques in data science, facilitating the analysis and interpretation of data.

 Here are five more practice questions that delve deeper into the concepts from the lecture:

1. Open-Ended: How can you demonstrate that the transformation A2 followed by A1 results in a different transformation than A1 followed by A2 using a specific example with vectors?
A1 = | 0  1|
     |-1  0|
A2 = |-1  0|
     | 0  1|
