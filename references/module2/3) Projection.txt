Projection - Module 2

• Definition and Types of Projection
    ◦ Vector Projection is the orthogonal projection of a vector a onto a straight line 
        parallel to another non-zero vector b. The result is a new vector that points in 
        the direction of vector b, scaled by the scalar projection. It's often denoted as 
        projb⁡a or a∥b.
    ◦ Scalar Projection (also called the component of b in the a direction) gives a numerical 
        value representing the length of the "shadow" of one vector along another. It's the 
        magnitude of the vector projection

• Formulas for Calculation
    ◦ Scalar Projection of vector S onto vector R: 
        [ \text{Scalar Projection} = \frac{R \cdot S}{|R|} ] 
        This formula uses the dot product of R and S, divided by the magnitude (length) of 
        R. It can also be expressed geometrically as 
        ‖a‖ cos θ, where θ is the angle between a and b.
    ◦ Vector Projection of vector S onto vector R: 
        [ \text{Vector Projection} = \frac{R \cdot S}{R \cdot R} R ] 
        This formula involves the dot product of R and S, divided by the dot product of R
        with itself (which is the square of its magnitude), then multiplied by vector R. 
        Alternatively, it can be written as ( a ⋅ b̂ ) b̂, where b̂ is the unit vector in the 
        direction of b.

        ▪ For example, to find the vector projection of q = [3,0,-1] onto p = [1,2,2]

            1. Compute the dot product q ⋅ p: (3)(1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(2) = 1.
            2. Compute the magnitude squared of p: 1² + 2² + 2² = 9.
            3. Compute the scalar projection factor: 1/9.
            4. Multiply the scalar by vector p: (1/9) * = [1/9, 2/9, 2/9]


for two vectors, r & s

cos(theta) = adj/hupotenuse = adj/|s|

-compared to def dot product

r.s = |r||s|cos(theta) 
|s|cos(theta) = adj
r.s = |r||s|cos(theta) 
r.s = |r|*projection

Scalar Projection
(r.s)/|r| = |s|cos(theta)  

Vector Projection
r * ((r.s)/(|r||r|)) = ((r.s)/(r.r)) * r
